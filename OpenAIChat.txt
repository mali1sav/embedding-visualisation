Your current implementation is highly sophisticated and aligns well with a theoretical model like Google's leaked framework. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to refine quality evaluation and better align with theoretical models like site focus alignment, topical depth, and overall content quality:

Strengths
Comprehensive Metrics:

Evaluating multiple facets like topical depth, technical depth, readability, structure, engagement, and freshness is robust.
Weights normalization ensures fair contribution to the final quality score.
Embedding Usage:

Utilizing text-embedding-3-small for semantic representation is effective.
Topic alignment through embedding metrics is directly tied to Google's purported embedding-based ranking mechanisms.
Freshness Considerations:

Including both content and metadata-level freshness indicators is critical for dynamic content domains.
Customizability:

Allowing users to tweak weights and categories ensures flexibility across use cases.
Suggestions for Refinement
Content Quality Subscoring Granularity:

Currently, subcategories like structure, readability, and technical depth are scored equally. Adjust weights within these components to better align with user behavior and search engine preferences.
Example:
Headers & Lists: Heavily weighted in informational and tutorial content.
Technical Depth: Heavily weighted for niche or advanced topics.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
structure_weights = {'headers': 0.4, 'lists': 0.3, 'paragraphs': 0.2, 'tables': 0.1}
structure_score = (
    0.4 * bool(re.search(r'#{1,6}\s+\w+', content)) +
    0.3 * bool(re.search(r'[-*]\s+\w+', content)) +
    0.2 * len(content.split('\n\n')) +
    0.1 * bool(re.search(r'\|.*\|', content))
)
Dynamic Keyword Contribution for Categories:

Use embedding similarity to assess how well content aligns with category-specific keywords, rather than simple term matching.
Incorporate cosine similarity between content embeddings and predefined keyword embeddings for scoring.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def calculate_keyword_alignment(content_embedding, category_keywords_embeddings):
    similarities = cosine_similarity(content_embedding, category_keywords_embeddings)
    return similarities.mean()
Enhanced Topic Depth Evaluation:

Extend beyond term frequency to assess semantic depth using clustering techniques.
Check for relationships between terms using co-occurrence or dependency parsing.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

def evaluate_topical_clusters(content, n_topics=5):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([content])
    nmf = NMF(n_components=n_topics, random_state=42)
    topic_matrix = nmf.fit_transform(tfidf_matrix)
    return topic_matrix
Freshness Evaluation with Decay Model:

Instead of fixed thresholds for content age, implement a decay function for scoring freshness over time.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
def freshness_decay(days_old):
    return max(0.1, np.exp(-0.005 * days_old))
Incorporate Content Complexity Measures:

Assess lexical diversity or advanced vocabulary use, as these are often proxies for technical depth and quality.
Use readability libraries like textstat for evaluating sophistication.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
import textstat

def evaluate_readability(content):
    reading_ease = textstat.flesch_reading_ease(content)
    lexical_diversity = len(set(content.split())) / len(content.split())
    return reading_ease, lexical_diversity
Outlier and Cluster Visualization:

Highlight outliers in visualization to identify pages diverging from the core focus.
Use clustering metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score) to assess coherence.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

def evaluate_clustering(embeddings, n_clusters=5):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)
    score = silhouette_score(embeddings, labels)
    return labels, score
Summary Statistics with Standard Deviation:

Include standard deviation alongside mean for metrics like quality score, topical depth, and freshness to identify variability.
Implementation:

python
Copy code
avg_quality = df['quality_score'].mean()
std_quality = df['quality_score'].std()
Final Thoughts
This approach provides a sophisticated and flexible model for evaluating content quality and relevance, which directly aligns with Google's theoretical scoring systems. By incorporating these refinements, the analysis will better capture the nuances of embedding-based site focus, topical depth, and quality evaluation.
